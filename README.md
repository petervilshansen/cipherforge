# AES-GCM File Encryption Utility

This repo contains multiple implementations in different languages of the same file encryption utility. Data encrypted by one implementation can be decrypted by any other implementation and vice versa.

## Who Wrote The Code?

Most of the code was written by CoPilot, ChatGPT, and DeepSeek AI with input prompts from me.

## Is It Safe?

Probably not. I've reviewed it myself, but I make no guarantees whatsoever. DO NOT USE THIS CODE IN ANY PRODUCTION SYSTEMS.
