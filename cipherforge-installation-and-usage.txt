CipherForge - Installation and Usage Instructions

This document provides step-by-step instructions for installing Python
and the necessary dependencies to run the CipherForge Python script.

1. Install Python:

   * Windows:
      * Go to the official Python website:
        [https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
      * Download the latest stable version of Python 3.x.
      * Run the installer.
      * Important: During installation, make sure to check the box that
        says "Add Python to PATH." This will allow you to run Python from
        the command prompt.
      * Complete the installation.
   * macOS:
      * macOS usually comes with Python pre-installed, but it might be
        an older version. It's recommended to install a newer version.
      * Go to the official Python website:
        [https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/)
      * Download the latest stable version of Python 3.x.
      * Run the installer and follow the instructions.
   * Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):
      * Open a terminal.
      * Run the following command: `sudo apt update`
      * Then run: `sudo apt install python3 python3-pip`
   * Linux (Fedora/CentOS):
      * Open a terminal.
      * Run the following command: `sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip`

2. Verify Python Installation:

   * Open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux).
   * Type `python3 --version` (or `python --version` on windows if only
     python 3 is installed) and press Enter.
   * You should see the installed Python version.
   * Type `pip3 --version` (or `pip --version` on windows) and press
     enter. You should see the pip version.

3. Install the cryptography Library:

   * The CipherForge script requires the `cryptography` library.
   * In the same command prompt or terminal, run the following command:
     `pip3 install cryptography` (or `pip install cryptography` on
     windows)
   * Wait for the installation to complete.

4. Download the CipherForge Script:

   * Download the `CipherForge.py` script to a directory on your computer.

5. Run the CipherForge Script:

   * Open a command prompt or terminal.
   * Navigate to the directory where you saved the `CipherForge.py` script
     using the `cd` command (e.g., `cd Documents/CipherForge`).
   * Encryption:
      * To encrypt a file, use the following command:
         * `python3 CipherForge.py -ef <input_file> <output_file>`
         * Replace `<input_file>` with the path to the file you want to
           encrypt.
         * Replace `<output_file>` with the desired path for the
           encrypted output file.
         * If you wish to provide a password, include the argument
           `-p "your password"`
         * Example: `python3 CipherForge.py -ef my_secret.txt encrypted.txt
           -p "MyStrongPassword"`
      * The script will generate a password (or use the one you
        provided) and display it on the console. Important: Copy and
        save this password in a secure location.
   * Decryption:
      * To decrypt a file, use the following command:
         * `python3 CipherForge.py -df <input_file> <output_file>`
         * Replace `<input_file>` with the path to the encrypted file.
         * Replace `<output_file>` with the desired path for the
           decrypted output file.
         * If you encrypted with a password argument, you must provide
           the same password with the -p argument. Otherwise, you will
           be prompted for your password.
         * Example: `python3 CipherForge.py -df encrypted.txt decrypted.txt
           -p "MyStrongPassword"`
      * The script will decrypt the file.

Troubleshooting:

   * If you encounter errors related to `pip` or `cryptography`, ensure
     that you have a stable internet connection and that your Python
     installation is correct.
   * If you get a "command not found" error when attempting to run
     python or pip, then you did not add python to your path correctly
     during installation. Try reinstalling python, and be sure to check
     the add to path checkbox.
   * If you have multiple versions of python installed, be sure to use
     `python3` and `pip3` to ensure you are using the correct version.
